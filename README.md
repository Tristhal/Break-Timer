# Break-Timer
A simply python script which reminds you to take a break while working. It uses a simple text interface which I quickly wrote for my own use.

- Displays a countdown showing the time until the next break
- Sends a notification to the user when its time to take a break and redirects focus to the window
- Once the break is over focus is automatically returned to the previous window
- The break time interval can be manually changed
- Works on Windows only
